      <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> Augusta Ada King, the Countess of Lovelace, was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke, Lady Wentworth. Lord Byron left Ada’s mother when she was just one month old, and died when Ada was eight years old. Despite this setback, Lady Wentworth promoted Ada’s interest in mathematics and logic, nurturing her gift for numbers. 

Her mathematical flair led Ada to work with fellow British mathematician, Charles Babbage. It was with him that she worked on the Analytical Engine; widely considered to be the world’s first computer. Ada realised that the machine had applications besides pure calculation, and published the first algorithm to be performed by such a machine. As a result, Ada is considered to be the world’s first computer programmer.

      <span>Why We Love Her:</span> Ada never saw her father in living memory. Nevertheless, Ada persevered. With the encouragement of her mother, she pursued mathematics, a field not generally encouraged of women in her time. Ada continued to excel despite living in a time when women were not permitted to attend university, own property, or vote, and were instead encouraged to be ‘ladylike’ in their refinements (whatever that means). 

In defiance of this, Ada was a revolutionary. Her unique take on science led her to examine the concept of the Analytical Engine in a way unlike others before her, including Babbage. Her lateral thinking, and the realisation that its power lay beyond pure calculation, has subsequently changed the world. I would not be sitting here writing this passage for Femspiration, or have even attended the Code First: Girls course without her insight. ‘Google’ would not be a household name, I couldn’t stream all the latest music via Spotify and I wouldn’t be able to have a good Facebook stalk sesh… What a different world it would have been! Although she may not have known it, this incredible young woman changed the modern world as we now know it.

Tragically, Ada died of uterine cancer at the tender age of 36. If Ada can read this message, Femspiration would like to give a massive shout out to this wonder woman for thinking outside of the box, and persevering with her talent despite her circumstances. We, in more ways than one, couldn’t do it without her! 

Thankfully Ada has been widely recognised for her efforts across the globe, and now has a day named after her! What a legend! Mark the second Tuesday of October in your diaries to remember this talented young woman and her superpowers!
