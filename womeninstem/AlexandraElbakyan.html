      <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> When Alexandra was working on her final year research project as a graduate student in Kazakhstan, she soon became frustrated that she could not afford to access the research she needed, as it lay behind a paywall. She then decided to learn how to bypass these barriers to acquire the material she needed. 
      </p>
<p>The word soon spread that she could access paywalled papers, and she soon had scientists from across the world asking her to liberate their desired documents. In 2011 she decided to automate the process and founded Sci-Hub, a <em> “pirate website that grabs copies of research papers from behind paywalls and serves them up to anyone who asks,” </em> (Nature). In 2016, Elbakyan estimated that Sci-Hub hosted 60 million papers and served up approximately 75 million downloads. Although she has faced much criticism, particularly from the publishing industry, many have praised her for her efforts to open up academic publishing to the masses. Currently many publishers are placing publicly-funded research behind a paywall at great expense to academic institutions applying for licenses to access this information. It is a huge cash-cow for the industry, worth billions of dollars annually. 
      </p>
<p>Whether or not Sci-Hub lasts the test of time (and its lawsuits), many agree that the shockwave it has sent through the industry has already changed the future of publishing. Sweden has already cancelled its contract with publishing giant Elsevier due to open access disputes, meaning a 13 million Euro annual loss for the company. Woohoo, you go Alexandra!

      <p><span>Why We Love Her:</span> Alexandra has gone against the grain, standing up to big business and multi-million dollar interests for the advancement of science. She has had a worldwide impact, not only helping researchers access the articles they need, but also, perhaps more importantly, she has changed the conversation around academic publishing on a colossal scale. The scientific world will never be the same.

<p><em>“Lack of access to the scientific literature is a massive injustice, and she fixed it with one fell swoop.” Michael Eisen on Alexandra Elbakyan (University of California, Berkeley)
  </em></p>
<p>Here’s to you, Alexandra, for being the incredible human being you are; for helping the underdog and advancing the scientific cause worldwide. You could have been scared by the threats you faced, but instead you stood tall and did what you thought was right. We take our (metaphorical) hat off to you, and only hope we can take inspiration from you to be bold and make positive change in our own communities.
      </p>
<p>Here’s to an open access future for all! Vive la révolution!
