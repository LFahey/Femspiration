    <div>
      <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> Little is known about Elizabeth’s life, even though she is one of the most significant early scientists. However, it is known that Elizabeth’s husband studied Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, which could mean that Elizabeth and him shared common interests.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><span>Notable Career Aspects:</span> Although Elizabeth was one of the most important scientists of her era, the only surviving evidence is the remarkable “Essay on combustion with a view to a new art of dying and painting wherein the phlogistic and antiphlogistic hypotheses are proved erroneous”. In her research, Elizabeth discusses methods, apparatus and materials she used in her various chemical experiments, along with some successful results. It also contained the earliest research into catalysis, which caused an uproar in the scientific community at Elizabeth’s time, but is a major backbone in the current chemical industry.</p>
