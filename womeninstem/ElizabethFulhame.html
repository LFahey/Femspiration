    <p><span>Who?</span> Elizabeth Fulhame</p>

    <p><span>What Field?</span> Chemistry</p>

    <p><span>Where?</span> Edinburgh, Scotland</p>
    
    <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> Little is known about Elizabeth’s life, even though she is one of the most significant early scientists. However, it is known that Elizabeth’s husband studied Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, which could mean that Elizabeth and him shared common interests.</p>

    <p><span>Notable Career Aspects:</span> Although Elizabeth was one of the most important scientists of her era, the only surviving evidence is the remarkable “Essay on combustion with a view to a new art of dying and painting wherein the phlogistic and antiphlogistic hypotheses are proved erroneous”. In her research, Elizabeth discusses methods, apparatus and materials she used in her various chemical experiments, along with some successful results. It also contained the earliest research into catalysis, which caused an uproar in the scientific community at Elizabeth’s time, but is a major backbone in the current chemical industry.</p>

    <p>"Censure is perhaps inevitable- for some are so ignorant that they grow sullen and silent and are chilled with horror at the sight of any thing that bears the semblance of learning, in whatever shape it may appear- and should the spectre appear in the shape of woman, the pangs which they suffer are truly dismal."

      <p><span>Why We Love Her:</span> Perseverance is one of the words that come to mind when reading about Elizabeth’s life. Almost the entire scientific community were wary of her, and it did not help that Elizabeth was reporting on controversial subjects for women at the time. Her imaginative and informative research demonstrate her intelligence, and her boldness is shown through her openly disagreeing with prominent male scientists of her time. The absence of Elizabeth in history demonstrates that women were not taken seriously at the time, and her findings were not deemed important enough by the men of her time. However, this is far from the truth, as Elizabeth was an important pioneer in scientific history, and is one of the key early women scientists that the world should remember!</p>
