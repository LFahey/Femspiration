    <p><span>Who?</span> Maryam Mirzakhani</p>

    <p><span>What Field?</span> Mathematics</p>

    <p><span>Where?</span> Tehran, Iran/California, USA</p>
    
    <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> Maryam received a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics from the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, then moved to America to pursue a PhD in Mathematics at Harvard University in California.</p>

    <p><span>Notable Career Aspects:</span> Maryam chose to research at Stanford University, while also working as a professor there. She also specializes in extremely complex theoretical mathematics, such as moduli spaces, Teichmüller theory, hyperbolic geometry, Ergodic theory and symplectic geometry. She was commended for bringing a new perspective to solving complex problems, by using a variety of creative approaches to solving them.</p>

      <p><span>Why We Love Her:</span> Not only was Maryam a brilliant mathematician, but also an extremely creative woman. Although she originally intended on being a writer, she discovered her passion for mathematics and then to pursue that. However, she never lost her creative streak, as many of the problems that were previously unsolvable, Maryam solved through a combination of extremely deep thinking alongside some abstract thinking. This absolute BOSS was also the first, and currently only, woman to have ever been awarded a prestigious Fields Medal, which is basically the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in Mathematics, wow!</p>
