      <h1>Maryam Mirzakhani<small> Theoretical Mathematician and Winner of a Fields Medal</small></h1>
      <p>1977-2017</p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <p><strong>Who?</strong> Maryam Mirzakhani</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>What Field?</strong> Mathematics</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Where?</strong> Tehran, Iran and California, USA</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>How Did She Get Here?</strong> Maryam received a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics from the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, then moved to America to pursue a PhD in Mathematics at Harvard University in California.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Notable Career Aspects:</strong> Maryam chose to research at Stanford University, while also working as a professor there. She also specializes in extremely complex theoretical mathematics, such as moduli spaces, Teichmüller theory, hyperbolic geometry, Ergodic theory and symplectic geometry. She was commended for bringing a new perspective to solving complex problems, by using a variety of creative approaches to solving them. </p>

    <div>
     <p><strong>Maryam's Quote</strong>  "I think it's rarely about what you actually learn in class . . . it's mostly about things that you stay motivated to go and continue to do on your own." (Maryam Mirzakhani press conference after winning Field's Medal in August 2014)</p>
    </div>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Why We Love Her:</strong>  Not only was Maryam a brilliant mathematician, but also an extremely creative woman. Although she originally intended on being a writer, she discovered her passion for mathematics and then to pursue that. However, she never lost her creative streak, as many of the problems that were previously unsolvable, Maryam solved through a combination of extremely deep thinking alongside some abstract thinking. This absolute BOSS was also the first, and currently only, woman to have ever been awarded a prestigious Fields Medal, which is basically the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in Mathematics, wow! </p>
