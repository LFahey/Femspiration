      <h1>Victoria Drummond<small> Britain's first female Marine Engineer</small></h1>
      <p>1894-1978</p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <p><strong>Who?</strong> Victoria Drummond</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>What Field?</strong> Marine Engineering</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Where?</strong> Perth, Scotland and London, England</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>How Did She Get Here?</strong> She was an apprentice in a Perth Garage, and was also trained by a professor at Dundee Technical College (now Abertay University), where she was taught maths and mechanics.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Notable Career Aspects:</strong> Victoria’s early career was spent on ships visiting Australia, China, Africa, India. During the Second World War, she served on many merchant ships, travelling across the world, including on convoys to America and Murmansk. After the war, she spent some time as a Chief Engineer on a number of vessels, and also worked as a superintendent in shipyards.  </p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <p><strong>Quote about Victoria</strong>  'Her conduct was an inspiration to the ship's company, and her devotion to duty prevented more serious damage to the vessel' ('The Times', 10 July 1941).</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Why We Love Her:</strong>  In a time where women were discriminated against if they sought careers in STEM, Victoria trained to be a Marine Engineer, and ended up being the first female at the Institute of Marine Engineers. Although she failed her Chief Engineer’s exams around 37 times due to prejudice against her gender, she ended up finally passing and was even awarded an MBE and Lloyd’s War Medal for Bravery at Sea later on. This BOSS lady taught us to never give up, and to keep pursuing your passions, even if it seems impossible. </p>
