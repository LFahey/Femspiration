      <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> Rosalind was an X-ray crystallographer based in King’s College London. Amongst other achievements, Rosalind provided the experimental evidence that led to the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the foundation of life on Earth. This groundbreaking discovery led James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. To add to her achievements, Rosalind pioneered work on solving the molecular structures of viruses. In 1982, her colleague Aaron Klug, who continued her work after her death, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1982.

Rosalind’s story has been shrouded in both controversy and tragedy, as Watson and Crick allegedly published her work on the structure of DNA without her prior knowledge or permission.   Watson, Crick and Wilkins’ Nobel Prize was awarded four years after Rosalind tragically passed away. Despite her tireless effort to solve a structure of major scientific significance,  the Nobel Committee decided not to award a posthumous award. The second Nobel Prize, based on her work on viruses, was awarded 24 years after her death.

      <span>Why We Love Her:</span> Without Rosalind working tirelessly on the molecular structures of nucleic acids, proteins and viruses, many other critical discoveries that were made after this breakthrough may not have come to fruition. 

We would also like to credit this incredible lady for overcoming a high amount of sexism to achieve what she did. Her work also led to four males being awarded Nobel prizes, allegedly on stolen work (in the case of DNA). 

Rosalind tragically died of Ovarian Cancer before realising the impact of her research on the world. One possible explanation for her death was her exposure to x-ray radiation. She literally died for her cause. Not only that, whilst she was undergoing cancer treatment, she continued to publish papers - amounting to thirteen papers in 1956 and 1957. When she passed away in 1958, she gave a proportion of her estate to charity. 

What an incredible inspiration to us all. Rosalind, even if the Nobel Committee do not recognise you, we at Femspiration would like to say a massive THANK YOU for your incredible contribution to society and for continuing to be the amazing lady that you are, right up until your death. If only we could meet you, we would give you our own ‘Total BOSS Lady in STEM’ prize. I hope you can read this from wherever you are. Rest in peace, Rosalind.
