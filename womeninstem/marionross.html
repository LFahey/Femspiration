     <p><strong>Who?</strong> Marion A S Ross</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>What Field?</strong> Physics</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Where?</strong> Edinburgh, Scotland</p>

    <div>
      <p><strong>How Did She Get Here?</strong> Marion studied Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. After a few years working on research projects, Marion also gained a PhD at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Notable Career Aspects:</strong> After university, Marion became an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Physics. There, she created a course in acoustics, which is still in use today! During the war, Marion worked on underwater acoustics and hydrodynamics for the admiralty, eventually being promoted to Head of the Research Group. After returning to the University of Edinburgh, Marion decided to focus on Fluid Dynamics, and became the first Director of the Fluid Dynamics Unit at the university. For her hard work, Marion was awarded a Readership Emeritus, and eventually became one of the earliest female Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p>

     <p><strong>Quote about Marion</strong>  “Marion Ross was an enthusiast and a person of high ideals and purpose. The type of person who looked for work that needed doing and got on and did it voluntarily. Her research in nuclear and X-ray physics, and in fluid dynamics, is internationally recognised and has inspired others to follow in her footsteps.” (Arnold Beevers and Clive Greated)</p>

    <p><strong>Why We Love Her:</strong>  Wow, how we could write pages about all of the amazing work that Marion has accomplished. Few women of Marion’s time were able to be as successful as she was in such a male-dominated profession. From setting up a fluid dynamics group at the University of Edinburgh, to becoming one of the pioneering women in acoustics and fluid dynamics, as well maintaining a lifelong love of music, Marion was an absolute boss. From completing all of her important research to being awarded some phenomenal awards, Marion has definitely paved the way for future female physicists and made a difference in the STEM community. </p>
