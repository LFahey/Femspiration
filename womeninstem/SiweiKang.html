      <p><span>How Did She Get Here?</span> Siwei initially started her undergraduate degree at the University of Washington in Architecture. That, however, was about to change; during her first year, she took a compulsory module in Computer Science. Siwei found so much inspiration from this course that she changed her degree, and subsequent career. She found inspiration from the interactivity of Computer Science, something that Architecture could not provide her. After graduating in 2012 with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Washington, Siwei went on to work for companies such as NVIDIA and Amazon, before emigrating to the United Kingdom to work for Skyscanner. Siwei is now a Senior Software Engineer and Engineering Manager with Skyscanner in Edinburgh, Scotland. Femspiration met Siwei through Edinburgh’s Code First: Girls community course. Siwei is now passing on the tech love as she helps to teach the next generation of budding female coders.</p>

      <p><span>Notable Career Aspects:</span> Siwei’s proudest achievement to date is the launch of her start-up “Trippo”. She has always wanted to have her own start-up, which formed part of the reason she moved to Skyscanner. Her previous employer, Amazon, did not have Intellectual Property Agreements favourable to her starting up her own business. Skyscanner, on the other hand, has a better attitude towards entrepreneurs amongst its workforce, and so she moved ‘across the pond’ to join us here in the UK!

Siwei is the CEO and Founder of Trippo, which was formed in her spare time whilst working for Skyscanner. It is formed on a concept Siwei is very passionate about - travelling. It is an app that is similar to Pinterest, but for travel. Any pictures or locations related to your travel itinerary are saved and geolocated onto a map, grouping all of your notes automatically into one place.  The app was launched last week (29th-30th November 2018) at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2018. Trippo was announced as a top pick at this prestigious tech conference; well done Siwei! You can check out Trippo here: https://gotrippo.com/

Not only is Siwei providing inspiration through her app Trippo, but she has been working on a large environmental project for Skyscanner ranking flights on their carbon emissions. Emissions from travel are becoming a more severe issue, so Skyscanner decided to act. Many people don’t associate travel with damaging the environment; it is their way to escape reality. As an organisation, Skyscanner can have a larger impact than as one individual. By ranking flights by carbon emissions, this opens up the conversation and brings it to the fore. Skyscanner is not trying to convert people, but rather wants to work with partners to promote social good. Airlines can make changes to their fuel supply, model of aeroplane, maintenance schedule, and more, to help improve their emissions ratings. In general, businesses will only change when consumers, or the law, force them to change. By changing one ranking metric on one of the largest flight-comparison websites in the world, Skyscanner can positively influence behaviour on a large scale. 

Wow, Siwei, keep doing you! *Sings: “Captain planet, she’s a hero...!”* </p>

      <blockquote class="colour-quote">''Fake it until you make it.” Siwei thinks that it is very easy for girls to get over-sensitive and feel like they are ‘imposters’ in a male-dominated industry. She says that the longer you’re in the job, the more you realise that the ones talking the most are often the ones faking the most, not necessarily the most knowledgeable. Siwei thinks that women have more self-awareness, and we need to use that to our advantage; “just because you’re quiet, doesn’t mean you’re not contributing or worth any less than the others in the room."</blockquote>

      <span>Why We Love Her:</span> Femspiration love Siwei for many reasons! Not only is she living her dream starting up her own business, and helping travellers across the globe, but she is providing a fantastic role model to the next generation of female coders. She is the embodiment of what is possible when you put your mind to something, and work hard at it. Not everyone believed in Siwei at first, but she persisted and is providing bucketloads of inspiration along the way! 
      
       Take heart girls, we can do this!
