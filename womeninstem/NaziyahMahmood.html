     <p><strong>Who?</strong> Naziyah Mahmood</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>What Field?</strong> Astrophysics and Aerospace Engineering</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Where?</strong> Glasgow, Scotland</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>How Did She Get Here?</strong> Educated at the University of Glasgow, where she gained an Honours degree in Physics with Astrophysics, as well as a Postgraduate degree in Space Mission Analysis and Design (Aerospace Engineering)</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Other Hobbies:</strong> Martial artist, model, actress, poet, and short story writer</p>
    </div>

    <div>

     <p><strong>Naziyah's Quote</strong>  In those moments when you feel so small, just remember; You may be one point in a vast universe of matter,
Yet inside you exists an entire universe that truly matters.
… You are limitless…</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Why We Love Her:</strong> Naziyah is truly the jack of all trades, with her love of STEM and space while also being a model, actress, poet and short story writer. Not to mention, her work achievements make her sound like a heroine from a novel: working on European Space Agency missions, as well as Particle Physics projects using data from the ATLAS Detector and CERN. She has proven to us that you really can do it all- have a career that you enjoy, but also make time for hobbies that you also care about. Not to mention she is visually impaired, but being the BOSS she is, demonstrates complete control in martial arts, which has allowed her to gain a keen sight of awareness.</p>
