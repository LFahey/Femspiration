    <p>Why We Love Her: Naziyah is truly the jack of all trades, with her love of STEM and space while also being a model, actress, poet and short story writer. Not to mention, her work achievements make her sound like a heroine from a novel: working on European Space Agency missions, as well as Particle Physics projects using data from the ATLAS Detector and CERN. She has proven to us that you really can do it all- have a career that you enjoy, but also make time for hobbies that you also care about. Not to mention she is visually impaired, but being the BOSS she is, demonstrates complete control in martial arts, which has allowed her to gain a keen sight of awareness.</p>
