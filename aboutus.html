      <p><span>Why am I coding?</span> After attending the Women in Technology Conference in Edinburgh in 2018, I was inspired by all of the fascinating women who spoke about their experiences in technology. Although each of them had different backgrounds in technology, they all shared one common trait, their passion for technology and getting more women involved in the field.
One of the women at the conference spoke about helping run CodeFirst:Girls, and as soon as I look further into the programme, I knew that I had to apply for it.

</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><span>Why am I coding?</span> I was inspired by one of my colleagues from the University of St Andrews who decided to upskill and attend a Code First: Girls course. She thoroughly enjoyed her time on the course and this subsequently led her to become a Solutions Delivery Analyst at Willis Towers Watson. This made me think, if she can code, I might give it a go too!
My dream is to try to learn enough code to be able to help sustainability-related organisations and non-profits improve their communications and outreach. I have a basic background in marketing and design, so I hope to use these skills in tandem to help the third sector gain greater reach. Although I am only in the early stages of my career, I have found communication to be one of the biggest challenges for small organisations. There is so much great work being done; let’s tell the world!

    <div>
      <p><span>Future plans?</span> I hope to continue to broaden my portfolio and complete Google’s Digital Garage certification, and use these skills to further sustainability aims. 
The first website I would like to design will be centred around the concept of mindfulness. I hope to encourage others to discover the love of nature through various natural ‘experiences’ consisting of a variety of self-recorded videos, sounds, images, and graphic designs.  I would like to work on the principle that Baba Dioum illustrates so succinctly: "In the end, we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, we will understand only what we are taught." I hope to encourage more people to fall in love with good causes, nature, and the outdoors, which, in turn, might inspire personal action. Keep an eye on my LinkedIn for the release of this. If you would like to collaborate, please just drop me a message on the email below.

      <p><span>Female role models?</span> Many of my most inspirational female role models in STEM are not celebrities, but incredible ‘every day’ women that I have crossed paths with. Along with some incredible female friends, teachers and other figures, here are a few that stand out in my life journey:

1. My mother. Along with my father, mum taught me to be a critical thinker, and to question the status quo. She fought for my science education and was the main inspiration behind me heading to Scotland for university. She is a fierce believer in female independence, has taught mathematics and chemistry across the world, and worked on science curricula for secondary school education in Papua New Guinea, amongst other achievements. My mother taught me to stand strong to my values, and keep chasing my dreams of a fairer, more sustainable world. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her inspiration, support and love each and every day.
2. My high school English and Theory of Knowledge teacher, Danielle Townend. She taught me to be strong and was one of the most positive, influential figures to me in my teenage years. She helped me continuously strive to do my best, and pushed me to write essays I was proud of. She helped me to ponder the nature of knowledge, and to be critical of where my information comes from.  Dani sadly passed away in 2016, but her memory lives on. Thank you for your complete dedication to teaching and to your students, Dani. I am honoured to have been taught by you. 
3. All the women who are standing up for what they believe in, particularly for the advancement of science and sustainability. Some prominent examples include Jane Goodall and her work on primates, Julia Gillard (former Australian PM) and her educational and environmental reforms, Nicola Sturgeon’s (Scotland’s First Minister) dedication towards encouraging women in STEM, and Larissa Waters’ (Australian Senator) dedication towards climate science. I would also like to give a special shout out to my excellent Psychology teacher, Zainab Ali, and to Naomi Arnold and Catriøna Patterson of Scotland’s 2050 Climate Group, among many, many others.

This is just a short list of a few of the inspirational women in my life. I could write pages on the gratitude I feel for all the women out there doing great things in STEM. Here’s a big shout out to all the unsung everyday STEM heroes past, present and future! Keep doing you.
